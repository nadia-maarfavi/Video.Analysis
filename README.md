# Video Analysis
This repository is a comprehensive collection of code snippets and tutorials on video analysis techniques. From extracting keyframes to converting each frame into images, this repository provides practical solutions and insights into programmatically analyzing videos. 
Whether you're a beginner exploring the fundamentals of video processing or an experienced developer seeking advanced techniques, this repository offers a valuable resource for understanding and implementing video analysis algorithms. With clear explanations and well-documented code samples, this repository serves as a practical guide for anyone interested in harnessing the power of video data for various applications, including computer vision, machine learning, and multimedia processing.

## Repository Contents

### 1. KeyFrameExtraction.ffprobe.ipynb
This file contains code designed to read a video file and extract its keyframes using the OpenCV library in conjunction with the FFprobe command.

### 2. LowLevelVideoFeatures.ipynb
This file is intended to read a video file and extract low-level features from each frame, including brightness, colorfulness, saturation, and contrast. It then calculates the mean and variance of each feature across the entire video sequence.

### 3. VideoShotsInfo.ipynb
This code is designed to analyze a video file, determine the total number of shots, compute the duration between shots, and calculate the mean and variance of the durations.
